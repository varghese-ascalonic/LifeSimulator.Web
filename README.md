# LifeSimulator.Web

Life Simluator is a sandbox to simulate life forms and their behavior. This implementation is loosely ported from my 
earlier project [LifeSimulator](https://github.com/Ascalonic/LifeSimulator) which was written in C# as a native windows application.

## What does it do
* Animals and food are spawned in the beginning
* Animals travels using their intuition, to reach the area with maximum accumilation of food
* Animals can see nearby food sources and they move in the direction of the same to eat it
* If the energy levels go below a limit, the animal will die
